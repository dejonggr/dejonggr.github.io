title: "Analysis of multiple *Brassica* transcriptomes reveals subgenome dominance in the response of *Brassica napus* to *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*"

excerpt: 'Allopolyploids are organisms which form due to the hybridization between two re- lated parental species, resulting in a whole-genome duplication. This phenomenon is particularly common among agronomically relevant plant species, partly due to the adaptive potential conferred through an influx of genetic material, and corre- spondingly, enhanced genetic diversity. However, these species must reconcile di- vergent parental transcriptomes, which can have profound consequences on global gene expression patterns — especially when confronted with environmental stres- sors. I used RNA-sequencing to investigate not only the response of Brassica na- pus to pathogen stress — elicited by the fungal necrotroph Sclerotinia sclerotio- rum — but also how this response manifested in its parental species, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, and a resynthesized allopolyploid B. napus formed directly from these species. This allowed me to identify a distinct bias to towards the B. oleracea-derived genome in both polyploids, which consequentially influenced the defence response of B. napus.'
