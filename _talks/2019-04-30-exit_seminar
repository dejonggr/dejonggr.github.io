Using RNA-Seq data I have surveyed the transcriptomes of root developmental zones and their constituent cell-types in paleopolyploid *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Incorporating such high-resolution data with further in silico analyses, I have demonstrated near-complete divergence in both gene expression and splicing patterns.

Additionally, to investigate the interplay between polyploid gene expression and biotic stress response, I subjected *Brassica napus*, *Brassica oleracea*, *Brassica rapa*, and a synthetic *Brassica napus* (formed directly from the aforementioned parental species of *B. napus*) to the economically devastating fungus *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. RNA-Seq data was generated for all pathosystems at 24 hours post-infection for both infected and mock infected samples. These data provide a win-dow into the transcriptomic response of polyploids under pathogen stress and illustrates a clear expression bias in parental subgenomes of *Brassica napus*.
