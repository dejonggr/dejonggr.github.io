This was perhaps my favourite project in graduate school. I was interested in seeing how polyploids responded to biotic stress - specifically subgenome-specific differences in stress response.

For a bit of background, this is an exerpt of my abstract:

>Whole-genome duplication (WGD; polyploidy) events have played an extensive role in the evolution of flowering plants. The sudden doubling of genetic material can expedite rapid novel changes to polyploid transcriptomes. For example, polyploids formed via an interspecific hybridization of closely related species, known as allopolyploids, can exhibit inconsistent expression patterns between their parental genome. These incipient disparities in parental gene dosage can have profound effects on the transcriptome of newly formed polyploids, which in turn can influence their response to environmental stressors. In particular, the extent to which the transcriptomic shock of polyploidization modulates the biotic stress response of plant species remains a nascent topic in polyploidy research. 

To do this, I grew four different *Brassica* species: *B. napus*, its progenitor species *B. oleracea and *B. rapa*, and a resynthesized *B. napus* (formed directly from the parental genotypes used in the experiment). These species were then subject to pathogen treatments (both mock-inoculations and fungal-inoculations) from the necrotroph *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*. Using three biological replicates per condition, this totalled in 24 RNA libraries which were run on the Illumina [NovaSeq 6000 platform](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/novaseq.html). 


Now, as much as I'd like to dive into the details, findings, and methodology of the computational aspects of the project, the manuscript for this project yet to be published so I'd prefer to keep things brief.
