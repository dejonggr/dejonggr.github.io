Projects
======

* Analysis of multiple *Brassica* transcriptomes under pathogen stress from *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*  
  * Designed an experiment investigating S.sclerotinia infection of
Brassica species and performed RNA-seq to generate
transcriptome data
  * Performed a priori analyses of synteny on the subgenomes of
polyploid Brassica napus and its parental genomes to identify
homeolog-ortholog relationships
  * Created pipelines to (1) generate gene expression data (2)
generate junction-specific alternative splicing data
  * Investigated Brassica responses to fungal necrotrophs and how
interspecific hybridization mightresult in non-parental
transcriptome responses to such stress

* A survery of ancient paralog expression patterns in
*Arabidosis thaliana* root cell-types
  * Created pipeline to generation expression and alternative splicing
data using publicly available cell-specific RNA-seq data
  * Performed analyses exploring the evolution of ancien duplicate
gene expression between Arabidopsisthaliana root cells
