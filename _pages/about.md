Research interests
======

I'm a recent graduate of the Genome Science and Technology (MSc) at the University of British Columbia

My research experience has fostered a strong foundation in bioinformatics, specializing in the analysis of sequencing data (RNA-seq, WGBS). Generally speaking, my primary interest lies at the intersection of biology and data science, through which I've developed extensive experience in data wrangling, shell scripting, R scripting, Python scripting, and server administration (UNIX).
